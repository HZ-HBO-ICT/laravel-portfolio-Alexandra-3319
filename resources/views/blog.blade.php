            <h2>Study choice</h2>
            <p>I took a gap year to look at what I was interested in as a job at not just as a hobby. I also took
                multiple test and did online research. (Corona limited my options)
                <br><br>
                I am a very curious person and like to know how things work up into detail. I think this kind of
                study and work will give me the opportunity to discover and adjust these things. Since the demand
                for ICT workers are high and workplaces give lots of opportunities to keep learning new things I can
                keep my interests wide and keep developing.
                <br><br>
                I want to find a job and maybe go abroad to do so. I hope during my internship to get an image of
                the jobs and maybe even get a job over. I am most interested in software engineering. Since it means
                Iwill be creating lots of things and I like to create. I expect to at least learn the basics of
                computers, engineering, coding and how a lot of existing programs work.

            <h2>Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
            <p>My Strengths:
                <br>
                I am great in working alone, concentrating, technical aspects and finding solutions.
                <br><br>
                My Weaknesses:
                <br>
                I am bad at keeping myself motivated and concentrated when it comes to subject that I am not
                interested in. Working together is not something I like doing.
                <br><br>
                Opportunities:
                <br>
                I am bad at keeping myself motivated and concentrated when it comes to subject that I am not
                interested in. Working together is not something I like doing.
                <br><br>
                Threats:
                <br>
                I am not good at planning things, and I tend to push work forward when I feel like I won’t do a good
                job. I am quite a forgetful person.

            <h2>Programming experience</h2>
            <p>I did a course at the HZ itself with O&O (research and design) with my previous school, Nehalennia,
                where we had to make our own little game with programming/coding. It lasted about a week and worked
                with others ICT students. At the end of the week, we also made an application for traveling students.
                It was quite a while ago, but I think it was English, I can’t remember the application we used but it
                was quite a simple one with easy basic coding. </p>

            <h2>First feedback</h2>
            <p>This is a small summary of the first feedback i got from my pitch. These are some of the main points.
                <br><br>
                Compliments
            <ul>
                <li>My code looks organized.</li>
                <li>It has a nice look and feel to it.</li>
                <li>(they didn’t say too much which also gives the feeling of not doing much wrong.)</li>
            </ul>
            Improvements
            <ul>
                <li>Using absolute positioning instead of other ways (fallacy, I don’t really understand how to work with the positioning)</li>
                <li>Spelling mistakes (carelessness, I am just bad at it, always have been)</li>
                <li>Need to combine more CSS (carelessness, prioritizing other things in the site)</li>
                <li>A wrong FAQ answer (fallacy, don’t really understand what else it’s supposed to be)</li>
            </ul>
            Code review Feedback
            <ul>
                <li>Absolute positioning was actually a solution but I guess that came back as feedback from the pitch to not use anymore.</li>
                <li>Making a stylesheet which I did expect there is room for improvement and was mentioned in the pitch feedback also.</li>
                <li>Cleaning up the look of my site which I did and there was no feedback about this in the pitch feedback.</li>
            </ul>
            Tasks
            <ul>
                <li>Work on my spelling.</li>
                <li>Find a way to fix the absolute positioning while keeping the look the same -fix the stylesheet and make my CSS simpler.</li>
                <li>fix small mistakes like FAQ answer.</li>
                <li>make my site more reactive.</li>
            </ul>
